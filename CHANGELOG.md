## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.4] - 2024-05-25

### Changed

- Trim files from built artifact.

## [0.3.3] - 2021-11-17

### Changed

- Require MFA for releasing.

## [0.3.2] - 2021-04-16

### Changed

- Ensure that `String#underscore` still uses acronyms when `ActiveSupport` is being loaded.

## [0.3.1] - 2018-08-18

### Changed

- Don't require `'active_support'`, just allow the user to side-load it.

## [0.3.0] - 2018-01-03

### Changed

- Use `include` instead of `prepend` for extending the inflector.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-01-02

### Changed

- Instead of needing `ActiveSupport` to be loaded before requiring `fast_underscore`, `fast_underscore` can now detect when `ActiveSupport` redefines the `underscore` method and automatically redefine at that point. Note that this basically flips the requirement such that `fast_underscore` needs to be loaded first (which is actually much faster).

## [0.1.0] - 2017-12-17

### Added

- Support for the Rails 5.2 beta.
